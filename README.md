Machine Learning
===============

This is a github sourse for some basic Machine Learning algorithms.

You can download and study this code freely. However, it's banned to use this code as 
homework or any other works that you should finish by yourself.

The codes are MATLAB code. Contents of the codes will be:

1. Linear regression(batch, stochastic, and maximum likelihood)

2. Bayesian regression

3. Logistic Regression

4. Nonparametric Methods(kNN, Locally Weighted kNN)

5. Decision Tree Learning

6. Artificial Neural Networks

7. SVM with cross-validation

8. clustering (k-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and dbscan)

9. PCA  and Singular Value Decomposition

10. Reinforcement Learning

  Enjoy the code.
